# PASM-assembler
A simple assembler written in C for my os (Polskasoft DOS). I tried not to use pre-defined functions to make it easier to use in free standing environments. It was hellish
## Why?
For fun, and to make my os actually able to do something
## Syntax
Kinda like NASM without commas. A more detailed description will come soon.
